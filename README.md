# LSTM for Time Series prediction

This repository was prepared with the objective of predicting the next value in a times series by utilizing a LSTM.

The purpose of this repository is to make it interactive thanks to the tool of streamlit.

In order to run locally, make sure that all requirements are satisfied and then run in the terminal:

```python
streamlit run app.py
```

It is possible to import .csv files, select the times series column, and modify the hyperparameters of the LSTM.

Also, there are three example .csv files that can be utilized to run the LSTM.
